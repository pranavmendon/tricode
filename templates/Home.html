    <h2 id="main1"> KEY BENEFITS OF <b id="cr">CHRONOPILOT </b>↓</h2>
    <br><p id="main2">
      <b class="main">Feature: Hyper-Personalized Scheduling<br></b>
      The agent doesn't give you a generic template. It builds a schedule from scratch based on your specific life—your subjects, your free time, your current skill level, and your exam dates.<br>
      Why it's useful: This creates a realistic and achievable plan that you can actually stick to. It prevents burnout by respecting your limits and eliminates the guesswork of figuring out what to study and when.<br><br>l

      <b class="main">Feature: Curated Resource Recommendations<br></b>
      After creating the timetable, the agent automatically finds and provides direct links to high-quality learning resources like videos, articles, and tutorials relevant to your subjects.<br>
      Why it's useful: This feature acts as your personal research assistant, saving you countless hours of searching online. You can spend more time learning and less time wondering if you're watching the right videos.<br><br>

      <b class="main">Feature: Friendly, Conversational Onboarding<br></b>
      The agent doesn't just present a form to fill out. It guides you through a polite, step-by-step conversation, asking for your name and needs in a natural way.<br>
      Why it's useful: This makes the process feel supportive and encouraging, rather than like a chore. It reduces the anxiety often associated with planning and makes you more likely to engage with and follow the plan.<br><br>

      <b class="main">Feature: Smart Modular Design<br></b>
      Technically, the agent is a sophisticated system where different "specialist" agents handle different parts of the task (like building the table or finding links).<br>
      Why it's useful: This makes the agent powerful, reliable, and consistent. Because each component is a specialist, the quality of the final, combined study plan is significantly higher than what a single, general-purpose AI could produce.<br><br></p>
